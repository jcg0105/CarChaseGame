# CarChaseGame
README

Instructions:
Use the arrow keys (left, right, up, and down) to move your car around the street. Try to avoid
the other cars on the road, otherwise it's game over!

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
Game requires WebGL and extra assests such as models, textures, and loaders. Make sure all of the
folders are downloaded to your computer and are saved in the same place before running. The game is played
through the CarChase.html file. 
Game will not run in Chrome unless a) you allow access from files or b) it is locally hosted. Microsoft Edge
or the equivalent should work. 

BUGS: 
Spawning the car obstacles does not seem to work. They should be a child of the ground sphere and randomly
spawn along points on the road, but they just stay in their starting places :(
