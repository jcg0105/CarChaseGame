# CarChaseGame
README

Instructions:
Use the arrow keys (left, right, up, and down) to move your car around the street. Try to avoid
the other cars on the road, otherwise it's game over!

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
Game requires WebGL and extra assests such as models, textures, and loaders. Make sure all of the
folders are downloaded to your computer and are saved in the same place before running. The game is played
through the CarChase.html file. 
Game will not run in Chrome unless a) you allow access from files or b) it is locally hosted. Microsoft Edge
or the equivalent should work. 

BUGS: 
Spawning the car obstacles does not seem to work. They start in their starting positions but then get rid of their scaling and their position does not stick to the sphere :(
